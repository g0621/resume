    - Built on microservice event driven architecture using NATS as event streaming bus.
    - BULL.js for event scheduling and queue
    - Uses redis's ZSET, HSET & LIST to maintain ranking and recent post queue. (tedis wrapper for nodejs)
    - Each microservice(containerized) deployed in separate pod, deployment automated using Skaffold.
    - Currently uses MongoDB to store all kind of data, planned separation based on structured and non structured data.
    - Creates a ranking of public posts within past 25 days based on up-votes. On personal page users can create their cards,
      app will remind them to revise every 1,3,5,7... days interval. with reset etc functionalities.
    - Ranks/orders personal cards based on due days of their scheduled revision.
    - Frontend made using React.

    - started with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kaggle.com/thekenjin/amazonapparelsdata?select=Amazon-clothing-info.csv"><b>Amazon dataset </b></a> having 183K data points.
    - Data preprocessing involved removing null valued points,similar titles short titles, steaming and removing stop words and special character from title.
    - Converted data points to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html"><b> TfIdf </b></a> vectors.
    - Similarities calculated using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances.html"><b> pairwise_distance </b></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html#sklearn-metrics-pairwise-cosine-similarity"><b> cosine_similarity.</b></a>

  points:
    - Trained multiple models on same dataset to achieve maximum accuracy.
    - Max accuracy of 94% was achieved using LSTM model.
    - Tried TfIdf, Hashing and Count Vectorizers to increase accuracy, TfIdf came on top for all models as dataset was text major.
    - Gained max accuracy using Multi-Nomial NB(88%), Passive-Aggressive(90%) models, Support vector Machine(88%).
    - Used Deep learning models MultiLayered Neural Network with TF (81%), with Keras(93%) and LSTM(94%).
